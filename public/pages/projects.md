## [AI Immigration - Kooch](https://kooch.help) ðŸ”—
- As a prospective master of computer science student in Canada, I spent a lot of time searching for international fully-funded programs and their related articles shared by applicants. So, I decided to create and maintain a completely free web application to help other to immigrate not only to North America but also to anywhere in the world. 
- First, I used [Figma](https://figma.com) to create a quick prototype and UX design to show investors and some of the candidate users.
- Then, I used [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org) to create the frontend initially.
- Simultaneously, I created the backend and APIs of the application using [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). 
- I used classification algorithms to better identify my clients and their behavior using the app. (Kmeans)

## [Sustainable Watershed Integrated Management - SWIM](https://swimwatershed.netlify.app) ðŸ”—
- The project is part of my internship program at [IBM](https://ibm.com). (Jan to Aug 2023)
- ReactJS, Redux, and Figma to create frontend of the application.
- Flask and RESTful API for endpoing API creation.
- JWT for authentication purposes.
- IBM DB2 as our main database was used.


## [EasyFood - Grocery App](https://easyfood.pythonanywhere.com) ðŸ”—
- As immigrants who are student, we don't have two important things: Time and Money ðŸ˜ƒ
- I had an idea whih will help people like us survive. EasyFood is a web-app in which I used big grocery markets (like Costco, Walmart, Real Canadian Superstore, Coop, etc) database as well as optimization algorithms to create an schedule containing all the food resources with prices. It has 3 different parts described below. The database is simply MySQL.

  - Marketplace APIs (Not Fully Available Yet)
    * Using NodeJS and Python (Flask), I get data from Walmart APIs in a daily basis.
    * Using python scrapers, I get data directly from webistes of big grocery chains when there is no publicly available APIs for it.
    * I created RESTfull APIs to use internaly in the application using ExpressJS.  

  - Web Frontend (Not Fully Available Yet)
    * React is the main framework I used.
    * Material UI is the main library for this proect. Also, I used Ant Design approach in some places when needed.
  
  - Mobile Application (Not Fully Available Yet)
    * I used React Native for this. The ourtput is available for both iOS and Android phones which makes it the most suitable way to use.


## [MachineCodes - React Auto Coding System](https://noworneverev.github.io/go-germany/) ðŸ”—
- The goal of this web application is to create React-based source codes.
- You can create a complete frontend website using visual tools in MachineCodes. It will allow you to have different pages and routes as many as you want. It is completely free to use. (No pro version)
- I created this application to show my curiosity in frontend developing using React. It is created using:  
  * ReactJS (I created a react-builder using react!)
  * ExpressJS, NodeJS as backend.
  * MongoDB as database. (I used a relational database instead of structured one for flexibilty purposes.)


## [VSCode Portfolio](https://github.com/ahsefati/vscode-cv) ðŸ”—
- What you are looking at right now.
- A vscode inspired portfolio project.
- Responsive Web Design. 
- Completely coded in React.
- The idea belongs to [Yan-Ying Liao](https://github.com/noworneverev)
